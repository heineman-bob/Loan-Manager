Loan-Manager
============

# Payments API Coding Exercise   

We need an API to manage a loan's scheduled payments.   The API should support:   

1. Retrieving a loan's scheduled payments  
2. Scheduling a new payment   

* Each payment should have  
  * date 
  * amount
  * We need to track whether a payment was successful or not.

Implement a Rails app with working API, DB schema, and any controllers, models, views, or other miscellaneous classes that you deem necessary.   Feel free to make whatever assumptions you like and note them in a README.
